            Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California. It currently consists of lead vocalist
            Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James
            Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar. Original members
            Levine, Carmichael, Madden and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while
            they were still in high school. After self-releasing their independent album We Like Digging?, the band
            signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. The album garnered a tepid
            response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college.

            with the band signed a new label, Interscope Records and Levine's own label 222 Records. Following the
            release of V, it reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2016, Maroon 5 recruited their long-time
            collaborator and former Phantom Planet member Sam Farrar, as the band continued with their sixth album Red
            Pill Blues, was released in November 2017, with the single "Girls Like You" peaking at number one on the
            Billboard Hot 100, becoming the band's fourth number one single. Maroon 5 has sold more than 109 million
            singles and 27 million albums, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.
